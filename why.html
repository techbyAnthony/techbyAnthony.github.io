            <p>I prefer Dogs over cats because dogs are more cool then cats. Even though they may whine a lot at the vet cats are rude and scratch people when they are trying to be cured by a sickness. Cats also were rulers in a way in egypt but dogs dont have that but have the title mans best friend, that sounds more peaceful then what cats have. They also protect you and stay by your side but do cats do that no they don't.</p>
